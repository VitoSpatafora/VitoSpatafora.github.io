            Chess is a strategy board game played between two players on a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors. 
            Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. 
            The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is under attack and cannot escape capture. 
            Chess requires logical thinking, planning, and a deep understanding of tactics and strategy.

            To begin, each piece has specific movements and rules governing its play. 
            Pawns can move one square forward or two squares on their first move and capture diagonally. 
            The queen, the most powerful piece, can move in any direction as far as possible. 
            Knights move in an "L" shape, while bishops move diagonally, rooks move vertically and horizontally, and the king moves one square in any direction.

        <ul>
            <li>The board should be set up so that each player has a light square in their bottom-right corner.</li>
            <li>The queen starts on her color (white queen on a white square, black queen on a black square).</li>
            <li>White always moves first, and players alternate turns.</li>
